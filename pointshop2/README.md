# Pointshop 2

## Welcome to Pointshop 2
Pointshop 2 is the next generation pointshop, coded from scratch to provide a better experience to both, server administrators and players. Its main features include easy creation and management of items, categories, players and settings through in-game menus as well as an innovative, inventory-based approach to item equipment. 

## Shop Management
It can be very frustrating as a server administrator to manage a shop system. Previously, items and categories would be created in Lua files, which is error prone, complicated and often a very tedious task. Frequently changing the map during modifications was very time consuming as well as making it impossible to play on the server.

Pointshop 2 takes a different approach, providing a visual interface to all options. Map changes are not required anymore and intuitive editors allow you to create items without a single line of Lua code. After item creation you simply drag & drop them into a category. Organizing your store has never been easier: create categories and up to three levels of subcategories using a simple tree editor. Click on the save button and all changes are instantly saved and sent to all clients.

## Smooth integration
Previously it could be frustrating for players to use the shop. Limitations such as not being able to use the shop while in spectator - which would be a perfect time to go shopping - are not present in Pointshop 2. It is always possible to customize ones appearance at any stage of the game.

Gaining points would previously mean waiting for some time and was usually solely based on the time spent playing. Pointshop 2 rewards active players by integrating into gamemode events. In TTT you are for example given points for identifying bodies, healing others and of course killing a traitor. No more people idling for points!

## Batteries included
The script comes with a set of exclusively designed trails as well as exclusively designed hats, accessories and badges. After installing your players can instantly have fun and play with accessories such as animated, funny pets that follow you around, animated hats and cool outfits, while you add and modify items to create an experience unique to your server.

## Multiple Currencies
A donator shop is an important feature for servers that are financed through donations.
Pointshop 2 supports your server by supporting two currencies: a standard, in game earned currency and an exclusive, premium currency. Integration into popular donation systems is being worked on.

## Extensible and customizable
Every aspect of the script can be customized. Full support for derma skins allows a complete visual makeover to fit your community's looks. The script itself is built in a modular and extensible way, you can expect many skins, addons and new item types to be made!

Technical choices such as allowing you to connect to MySQL or SQLite enable tight integration with your systems as well as the flexibility you need. A module based approach makes sure that 

No more trouble with addons breaking your server: All addons to pointshop 2 go through an extended quality review to make sure that no matter what, you always get the best addons. A list of addons supporting and approved by Pointshop 2 will be added here. 

## Premium Support
As always, the price includes not only the script but also support. If you are having trouble setting the script up or need help customizing, your questions and requests are always welcome and will be handled as quickly as possible.

The script will be updated to all future gmod version and stay in active development, receiving bug fixes, functionality updates and tweaks heavily influenced by your feedback.
